🚀 AI Powered Resume Screening Tool

An AI-driven application that automatically evaluates resumes, extracts important information, and scores them based on job-specific requirements using NLP and Machine Learning.

⸻

📌 Overview

This tool streamlines the recruitment process by analyzing resumes and ranking candidates using intelligent text processing. It reduces manual screening workload and improves the efficiency of selecting the right candidates.

The system extracts:
✔ Skills
✔ Experience
✔ Education
✔ Achievements
✔ Relevant keywords

And compares them against a job description to produce a compatibility score.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Preprocessing

Resumes are cleaned using NLP techniques:
	•	Removing punctuation
	•	Lemmatization
	•	Stopword removal
	•	Lowercasing

2. Feature Extraction

TF-IDF converts resume text and job descriptions into vector embeddings.

3. Similarity Scoring

Cosine similarity computes how closely a resume matches the job requirements.

4. Ranking

Resumes are sorted by total match score.
